Booktype setting allows for setting the booktype of a +R/+RW and +R-DL DVD disc to DVD-ROM.
This improves compatibility for some older commercial players.
The booktype of minus media cannot be changed.

RPC1 removes region checks and commands.

Auto-Reset prevents the drive from permanently storing region code changes.

There is a risk involved in flashing with experimental firmware,
so if you do not wish to assume this risk, please do not flash your drive
